# i2pdig

Lookup an i2p hostname, base32, and base64 from the terminal with a user-defined jump service.

This is a simple program which requests a hostname from any existing i2p jump
service(but it's using my selfhosted one by default for now, that may change, I
just didn't want to annoy anybody by overusing theirs, and instead of following
the redirect parses the addresshelper URL, derives the base32 address from the
base64 address, and outputs them all to the terminal. Sort of like a standalone
dns resolution program, but for i2p jump hosts.

As an added bonus, you can also do this:

        . <(./bin/i2pdig -url i2pforum.i2p)
        echo "        $base32" | tee -a README.md
        http_proxy="http://127.0.0.1:4444" surf "http://$base32"


and get the output:

        tmipbl5d7ctnz3cib4yd2yivlrssrtpmuuzyqdpqkelzmnqllhda.b32.i2p

and also automatically launch your web browser.
